           Overview
        </h2>
        <p class="intr">
            Welcome to my final project website! It's based entirely on the Learning How to Learn Course and the course book - <em>A Mind for Numbers</em>. All the non-anecdotic information comes from these sources unless stated otherwise.

        <p>
            Right at the beginning at of the MOOC, a concept was introduced: there are two modes of thinking: focused mode being the one everyone is acutely aware of. Associated with studying by default, the idea behind focused mode is rather self-explanatory: it includes step by step problem-solving in state of deep focus. It’s in the focus mode that chunks, or reusable mental tools we’ve memorized, are formed. This is crucial because, on average, our working memory has four slots and the more information is stored within such a chunk, the more space is left for new concepts.
        </p>
        <p>
            The second option, diffuse mode is different. It runs in the realm of the unconscious, making loose associations between seemingly unrelated ideas or providing a solution to the previously unsolvable problem. That is because it breaks the constraints of Einstellung – state of strong fixation on one way of approaching the problem that clouds our judgement and makes us completely miss the point. In the extreme cases, one can look directly at the solution without seeing that it is, in fact, what they’ve been looking for. Diffuse mode can also help us make connections between various chunks from different fields. For example, I found syntax of JavaScript a bit similar to Japanese grammar: array methods resemble verbs that are always at the end of the sentence in Japanese. Computer programming languages and natural languages are both referred to as languages, but if somebody told me during my studies that I’ll be using concepts from Japanese grammar to intuitively understand computer programming, I’d probably laugh aloud. Instead, a connection was made.
        </p>
        <p>  
            What’s more, I’m not even sure whether it would be possible without two different actions I took: by the time I became a Japanese major student, I had already learned two foreign languages: English and French. Both are quite different from Polish and, in line with Agnieszka Lun what once stated: “we live a different life in every language we know” , I symbolically left my zone of comfort and started an entirely new life, with a completely different notion of what language is. My thoughts were never the same, as my thoughts became far from monolingual. Because of that multitude of linguistic systems intermingling with each other inside my head, I was able to approach JavaScript concepts as another system to be learned. The main difference was that I don’t need to speak in it. Which, given my introverted nature, is rather convenient. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Education on how diffuse mode works and how it can be triggered is what lacks a lot of students and what makes us prone to closing ourselves in a box made of ideas that feel comfortable to us – be it humanities or science. After all, Einstellung means “mindset” in German and that is precisely what often holds us back.
        </p>
        <h2>Personal reflections</h2>
        <p>
            Let me start by giving you a bit of a context: I didn’t really struggle at school and, in comparison to others (this one is important part I’ll come back to in essay 3), wasn’t prone to procrastination: my earliest memory related to learning is me studying ahead and finishing the textbooks months before the lesson took place. 
        </p>
        <p>
            However, I was always notorious for living inside my head and thinking. On the bright side, entertaining loose big picture associations comes naturally to me, as if I was living in a haze of diffuse mode on a daily basis. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Looking back to my learning journey, I’ve realized that luck was on my side way more often than I’ve thought. My natural intuitive inclinations armed with focus mode studying imposed on me by how education system works have thrown me into some sort of balance. During the course, I realized that it might have been the key to my successes and, at the same time, the reason why learning became much more difficult after graduation: there’s no one to impose focused thinking on me anymore. No one to tell me not to overwork myself, that I’ve learned enough and that I deserve to rest, that I’m ahead anyway so it won’t hurt to slow down (because, once again, as there’s no system, who’s to decide whether I’m ahead or not?). As a result, ever the extreme. I often end up either lazing around all day or overworking myself to the point of nearly collapsing. 
        </p>
        <p>
            And, more than everything, I’m almost never satisfied with the amount of work I’ve done.
        </p>
        <p>
            The idea that relaxation is crucial to the learning process sounds like a great argument to calm myself down. So, if you’re like me, struggling with work-life balance more than procrastination, you should remember the realization that B. F Skinner, a psychologist quoted in A Mind for Numbers, made: “When I am not working, I must relax – not work on something else.”   Otherwise, we’re on a way to burnout and lose of efficiency, not a life-altering breakdown. After all, our goal is to work smarter, not harder. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In this project, I intend to explore and reflect on the strategies presented in the MOOC that I think will work the best for me, not necessarily all the course’s content. It is important to remember that different things work for different people and my approach to the content might not be the most efficient for every reader.
