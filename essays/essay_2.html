            Procrastination. When you ask an average person what is the main obstacle that have arisen when they tried to make dreams their dreams come true, a lot of answers might be summarized in that one word. Lack of motivation, perseverance or self-confidence, fear of taking the next steps – all of those are somehow related to that one issue.
        </p>
        <p>
            Overcoming procrastination is one of the most important goals one must achieve to finally feel satisfied in life. Fortunately, there were many who came before us, leaving useful tips and tricks to help us with the struggle.

            First, there’s the Pomodoro (or tomato in Italian) technique. It consists of setting 25 intervals of learning without breaking the focus and rewarding yourself after the time’s up. One of the biggest benefits of this kind of study organization is that it imposes the so-called process orientation. During a Pomodoro session, you don’t set yourself any concrete goals: it’s the process of working that matters. The reason why this kind of mindset is important is very simple: because the source of suffering a procrastinator feels while thinking about what’s yet to be done is the product. The fear might have different forms: in my case, it was the dread of how much effort is required before the product is finalized. It often made me very selective and reluctant to give myself new challenges, as I knew I’d be obsessed that the task is not finished yet. Focusing on a process, it’s easy to finish what you’ve planned: because you’ve only planned to work for your chosen interval of time. Not finishing X and Y and Z. Just working and rewarding yourself after. It’s not as scary, not as imposing as product-oriented planning and gives surprisingly good results. Just by doing that I reduced the amount of time I normally spend procrastinating: because I want that reward. For example, I tell myself that I want to drink a cup of my favorite tea, but I don’t allow it to myself before I finish the first Pomodoro. So, I start to work and find myself dumbfounded each time I realize that those 25 minutes are already over, and I can enjoy my tea. And almost every time, I feel I can as well go on, if the time has passed so quickly. As a result, I start another session, sipping the tea and enjoying the pleasant feeling of getting my stuff done.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I have a complex task ahead me, it’s rare to finish it in 25 minutes, but it’s fascinating how much you can actually achieve focusing for such a short amount of time. Getting into the rhythm might be difficult, but once you start, it’s easy to maintain it. Furthermore, the better you are at the subject, the more enjoyable it becomes. As dr Barbara Oakley explained, it’s perfectly normal to start without any enthusiasm. If we were to work only when we feel excited or motivated, we would never be able to get rid of the habit of procrastination.

            You might remember that I mentioned being ahead of the class during my school years. Why am even writing about procrastination when I’m clearly not the main target of this part of the course then? That’s simple: because I realized that, even though I start ahead, I still procrastinate. It takes a different form: I’ve been planning to do something all day and instead of eating my frogs first, getting stuff done, I’m suffering for half of the day just because of the perspective of working on the product and starting to actually do it at the evening. Only that it’s a month before the deadline. I used to be extremely lazy about the way I am learning, with my Phone right next, messaging a friend every now and then while working on a project. It was still effective, as even if you work in a lazy way, but do it regularly and leave yourself a lot of time to absorb the material, the results won’t be bad. All I’m trying to say is that I could have had much better results, working less and feeling better if I learned in a more effective way right from the beginning. It’s easy to say a problem doesn’t concern you because you’re not the most serious sort of procrastinator, a bit more difficult to admit you weren’t doing things the right way.

        <h2>
            MEMORY AND CHUNKING
        </h2>
        <p>
            I mentioned the concept of chunking briefly, but now it’s the time to delve a bit deeper into the subject, as it’s directly related to how memory works. To begin with, it’s important to distinguish between two types of memory: short-term and long-term. The first, also called working memory is rather blurry and can hold a limited amount of information. The latter, compared to a large storage room, is filled with variety of information from different fields that need to be recalled regularly to be accessible. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Basically, new data is consolidated from your working memory to the long-term memory and reconsolidated from your long-term memory to your short-term memory. The amount of information your working memory can hold depends on how well chunked the concepts you learned are. It’s said that it can hold about four pieces of information, but there’s no establish weight of information: it’s true that a beginner might be able to access only four concepts at the same time, but an expert with a huge library of chunks might as well store four concepts within one chunk and effectively access sixteen.
        </p>
        <p>
            How to form a chunk? Focus is the key. You need to actively work on a problem, so that its different aspects become more and more visible to you. While doing so, don’t forget that understanding follows two patterns that meet somewhere in-between: bottom-up focused mode understanding of the steps you need to take to solve the problem, and up-down big picture vision. You need both to truly master what you’re trying to learn. Lastly, there’s understanding when to use, and, what’s maybe even more important at the stage of chunking the information, when not to use the solution that you’ve conjured up. 
        </p>
        <p>
            There are two things to keep in mind in relation to chunking: just understanding the solution is not enough to form a solid chunk. The idea refers to, for example, the following circumstances: you frequent a course during which you encounter a problem that seems unsolvable to you. The teacher explains how to solve it and then everything clicks, similar to what you might experience when your diffuse mode suddenly reveals the solution to you seemingly out of the blue. Why is it different then? Because you didn’t go through the whole process, you didn’t grasp the entirety of the big picture. If you realize it and try to analyze why the problem should be solved this particular way and then try to apply the solution to other problems, you may still form a solid chunk, but it’s important to not get caught in illusions of competence when it was not you who solved the problem.
        </p>
        <p>
            Second, useless chunks do exist. If you’re not really focused while learning, you might end up getting the wrong connections. It’s important to focus on what you’re learning long enough for your brain to start creating new neural connections. Shifting your focus between two different subjects too often is detrimental to your overall learning process. And, by too often, I mean every two minutes or other ridiculously short amount of time. Variety of subjects in your study plan is a great idea, linked to the concept called interleaving which is a more efficient way to absorb knowledge than endless revisions of a concept you already mastered (overlearning). By switching your focus to another concept (maybe even in a different field) you’re boosting your creativity by allowing your mind to create interdisciplinary chunks like the one I mentioned in essay 1. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Here's my approach to the subject: my project for this website consists of two major parts: writing and coding. I scheduled my working so that I alternate them between each Pomodoro section. This way, I let my diffuse mode run in the background. What’s more, during the “writing” parts I jump between my essays, trying to recall various parts of the course. Which brings us to another subject – effective self-testing. A lot of common learning habits, such as underlining whole paragraphs of text do us more harm than good. They create illusions of competence as it’s easy to trick yourself into thinking that just because your hand is moving, you’re learning and remembering things. If you can repeat what you’ve read only when looking at the textbook, it means you’re fooling yourself: try to get up, exercise a bit and then recall the main concepts of what you’re trying to understand – it’s much more effective than just rereading or staring at the textbook.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another powerful tool is visualization. Especially what’s called “mind palace”: you think of a place you know very well and try visualizing concepts related what you’re currently trying to learn. Place those visualization, the funnier the better somewhere in the place thought of. For example, when I first read about the technique, I’ve been learning about classes in JavaScript. It was a part of Object-Oriented Programming module in a Udemy course that I’ve been watching, interleaving my studies with Learning How to Learn MOOC. The image I thought of while trying to turn JavaScript classes into symbols were a construction site that a crazy teacher tried to turn into the classroom screamed that any place could become a class if you use the right method. The entire scene took place in the garden of my family house. A loud voice from who knows where singed “It’s object-oriented programming!”. I don’t think I’ll ever forget that you can place a constructor and define the object’s methods within a class. No need to memorize all the details by heart. Learning like that can be surprisingly fun!
