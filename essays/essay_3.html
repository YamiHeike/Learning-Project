        <h2>
            HABITS, WILLPOWER AND... CURBS?
        </h2>
        <p>
            Habits dictate our everyday life, they constitute the ever-present patterns in our daily routines and, as stated in the course, the “zombie” part of ourselves that automatically do their thing, without pondering about the consequences. Procrastination is one of them. Or, more precisely, reaction to the procrastination cue.
        </p>
        <p>
            To understand how to get rid of harmful habit, one must first analyze the basic structure of a habit: cue, routine, reward, belief (or CRRB, a peculiar, erroneous way to write “curb, which is how I memorized the steps). 
       </p>
       <p>    
            First there is a cue, a temptation: it might be a message from a friend that is much more interesting than your study plans (especially if you’re initially not in a mood), an advertisement or even another thing you’d prefer to be learning. In brief, anything that keeps your attention away from working on your current goal. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Then, there is routine. The usual course of action taken when the cue appears or, in other words, reaction to the cue. This is the tricky part that requires actual effort to change. Third factor is reward. Human brain releases dopamine in anticipation of reward, which is why it’s so easy to fall into detrimental habits – the reward in such cases is instantaneous. In this regard, procrastination is like addiction: you might feel good the moment you engage in it, but the long-term consequences might be tragic. Which is why when planning on developing a new habit, you need to be smart about it and consider developing a reward system. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Lastly, there’s belief. A crucial part of every new-emerging positive habit: you need to trust that your new system is enough to automatize it and turn it into a well-trained zombie. In my opinion, one of the most interesting take-aways from the course is the idea that planning quitting time is as important as planning working time. Right now, as I’m writing this essay, I’m using the Pomodoro technique (read more about fighting off procrastination) with a clearly defined quitting time and I’ve set myself my first definite deadline ever.  Knowing I’ve only have so much time during the study session really works, I’m determined to cross out every single point from my list. It is the opposite of procrastination. Without belief, the idea of setting such a clear deadline wouldn’t make much sense: after all, its purpose is to enjoy guilt-free leisure time after the work is done. If you don’t believe that’s the right thing to do, the reward won’t feel like a reward and your inner zombies be reluctant to the idea of integrating the habit into your daily routine. After the first time, they’re probably try to rebel anyway. The first step is always the hardest, but the next ones don’t need to hurt as much if you enjoy the outcome of the change you’ve made.
        </p>
        <p>
            The good news is that you need to apply your willpower only to the first R in CRRB. Willpower itself, being a valuable resource, shouldn’t be wasted on trivialities. If you change the reaction to the cue that arises during your studying routine, the rest will follow automatically: because you continued studying instead of changing that new message that have just arrived, you ended your session according to the plan and so you can now have your reward and believe it’s effective: after all, something has changed. Ignoring distraction will eventually become a default reaction to procrastination cues.
